## Introduction

Welcome to the Yonsei DATUM Club's Job Portal project for international students in South Korea. This repository is the central hub for our efforts to create a platform that facilitates job hunting and provides valuable insights for international students in South Korea, particularly those graduating from Korean universities.

## Project Overview
### Sub-plan
Our project involves several key components:

1. **Database Development**: We will create a database that houses relevant job hunting statistics in South Korea. This data will serve as the foundation for our analyses.

2. **Data Analysis and Visualization**: Using the database, we will generate graphs and visualizations to gain insights into the job market for foreign students graduating from Korean universities.

3. **Web Scraping**: We will employ web scraping techniques, both manual and automated, to collect data from various sources, including job openings from company websites and job portals.

### Tools
To accomplish our goals, we will utilize the following tools and resources:

- **Database**: Notable.io will replace Google Colab and Jupyter Notebook to overcome technical limitations.

- **Data Collection**: Kaggle will be used to gather datasets, and we will also explore new programming knowledge.

- **Research**: Google Scholar will provide insights into the proportion of foreign workers employed by nationality, industry, and other relevant factors, along with information about foreign job portals.

- **Job Listings**: We will source job listings from various platforms, including Career | K-campus, UIC Careers Page, Yonsei GSIS Page, LinkedIn's "Jobs" section, JOBKOREA, Saramin, Seoul Foreign Portal, Seoul Craigslist, Wanted, and Job Planet.

### Communications
Our primary mode of communication will be through KakaoTalk. We will also use Google Drive to maintain a shared folder (23-2 Yonsei DATUM) for collaborative document management.

### Additional Plans
- **GitHub Page**: We are considering creating a GitHub Page to showcase our project's progress and findings.

- **Team Introduction**: We plan to introduce our team members, fostering a sense of community and collaboration among our members and potential users.
